/* Task 1: Create two variables: One that holds a fictional user input (a number of
        your choice) and one that holds no value initially (e.g. "result"). */
let UserInput = 6;
let result;

/*Task 2: Set the result variable to 18 plus the value stored in user input. */
result = 18;

/* Task 3: Add three additional lines of code where you change the result variable
        again (by subtracting a value of your choice, multiplying it and
        dividing it). */

result += 6;
result *= 2;
result /= 3;

/* Task 4: Think about the value stored in the user input variable you also created - did that value change?
   Answer  = No;

*/

/* Task 5: alert() the result and the user input variables (in two separate alert() calls). */

alert(result);
alert(UserInput);
